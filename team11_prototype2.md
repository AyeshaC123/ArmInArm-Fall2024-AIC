### Prototype 2
This prototype fully implemented the tooltips feature in the registration form UI and began the implementation of the admin panel for form reviews.  Reviews are flagged as for review before they can be approved, and the approval button works.  Further steps to complete this implementation include being able to view the form before approval, being able to edit the form, and denying forms if they are spam or not filled out correctly at all.
