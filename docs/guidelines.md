                            Guidelines for Collaboration and Growth

1. Community/Users First: 
   The community and users must be prioritized, their needs must be addressed and their feedback is crucial. Make sure to regularly consult with Arm in Arm staff and/or users
   to make sure that the proposed functionality effectively addresses their needs.
2. Code of Conduct: 
   You must abide by the ACM Code of Ethics, making sure to promote a respectful and collaborative environment.
3. Clear Documentation: 
   You must do yourself and your fellow developers a favor by making sure to contribute to and maintain clear documentation. This includes set-up and installation guides,
   usage instructions, and detailed comments to help in others' understanding and usage of the software.
4. Regular Communication: 
   Make sure to engage in regular conversation with peers and other stakeholders through designated channels such as Slack and Github. This is to ensure efficient and streamlined collaboration. Team 24 would meet weekly on Fridays at 6PM via Zoom. Team 24 would regularly communicate via text in a group chat, to delegate and if necessary reschedule meetings. At the end of every meeting, a summary of the meeting along with tasks would be added to a shared "Meeting Notes" document for members that may have been absent from the meeting to catch up on what was discussed. 
5. Quality Assurance: 
   Ensure good quality by writing tests, conducting code reviews, and engaging in manual testing. This is to uphold high standards of quality and performance.
6. Feedback and Iteration:
   Make sure to give and be open to receiving feedback from peers and fellow contributors, to continuously refine and improve the application.
7. Inclusive Designs:
   Make sure that implemented design practices are accessible to all users, including those that have disabilities. Test the user interfaces for accessibility and
   make adjustments as needed.
8. Adopt Agile Methodologies:
   Make sure to implement agile methodologies to ensure adaptability to changing needs as well as rapid implementation of changes based on feedback.
