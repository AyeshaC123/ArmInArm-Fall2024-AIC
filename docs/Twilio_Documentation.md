Twilio is an API that allows for sending and receiving text messages, which is needed to be able to send appointment reminder text messages to clients. 

Twilio offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model, with each text costing $0.0079 per text sent. 
The link for more information on Twilioâ€™s pricing can be found [here](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/sms/pricing/us).

Twilio also offers discounted/fully covered messaging costs for non-profit organizations through its Impact Access Program. ArmInArm can fill out the needed forms to apply for the program and speak to a Twilio Sales associate to find out whether they are eligible to receive benefits from the [Impact Access Program](https://www.twilio.org/support-and-resources/impact-access-program). 

In order for the appointment reminder functionality to work, ArmInArm would need to follow the above steps to create a Twilio account. After successful account creation, you'll arrive at your project dashboard in the [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/login?g=%2Fconsole%3F&t=2b1c98334b25c1a785ef15b6556396290e3c704a9b57fc40687cbccd79c46a8c). This is where you'll be able to access your Account SID, authentication token, find a Twilio phone number, and more.
