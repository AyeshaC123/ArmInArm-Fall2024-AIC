# Guidelines for future development

## Mission
To create a volunteer scheduler which assigns volunteers to a role based on their interests and strengths. 

## Motivation
By assigning volunteers to roles based on their interests and strengths it helps Arm In Arm to be able to do their work efficiently and effectively. It takes away the time needed to assign volunteers as well as puts volunteers in the position that they are best fit for. Our end goal is to help the staff at Arm In Arm as much as possible so that they are able to do their job and fulfill their mission to the best of their abilities.

## Team Code
All potential contributors must adhere to the [Team Code](https://github.com/TCNJ-SE/ArmInArm-F23/blob/a95e1cc5ba7152c65820deddf1798b04d4099144/docs/Team13-TeamCode.md)

## How to contribute
