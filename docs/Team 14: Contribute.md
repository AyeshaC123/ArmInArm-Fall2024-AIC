# Opensource Maintenance and Communication
Thank you for interest in contributing to this project.
All communication and maintenance are manged using GitHub's specific tools for these tasks.
## Guidelines
- GitHub Issues will be used for notification of bugs, introduction of features, and conversations about specific implementation.
- Code contribution will take place through the use of individual branches intantiated for implementing each new feature. These branches cannot be merged back with the main deployment branch without a code review and approval by a verified administrator through the creation of a detailed and descriptive pull request.
- No code will be accepted, even if it submitted through a fully-detailed pull request, if it is detected to provide an behavior seen as malicious or counterintuitive to the needs of the project.
