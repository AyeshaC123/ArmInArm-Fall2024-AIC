# Principal Guidelines
**1. Wednesday Meetings**
   * Weekly meetings are held virtually over Zoom around 3 pm every Wednesday
   * Attendance. If a group member is going to be late or miss a meeting, they must try to inform everyone at least 3 hours in advance. 
   * A legitimate reason for missing a meeting is if there is a family emergency, you are ill and cannot attend, or there is something that you can not get away from. When a group member misses a meeting, they must get the missed information and find out what they may be responsible for. If a group member misses a meeting without notifying the rest of the group of extenuating circumstances, the member will receive a verbal warning.
   * Needed adjustments can be announced on our Slack group chat
   * Have progress to show to fellow team members for each weekly meeting

**2. Use Slack to communicate with fellow team members**
   * Must have Slack notifications on.
   * Must keep up with Slack on a daily basis at minimum.
   * Must participate in group communications and direct messages, and respond in a timely manner.

**3. Help each other whenever possible**
   * When an individual experiences a roadblock, or setback, or technical difficulties we work together to solve the problem.
   * When a group member is finished with their own progress, they may look over and provide aid to other members of the group.

**4. Participation**
   * During the meetings everyone is encouraged to speak freely and is expected to listen attentively. If someone is not participating, this person will be asked for opinions.
   * Ensure that important decisions are made only after every team member has given their input
   * Group members are expected to take part in implementations and provide code reviews to other members when needed. 

**5. Group Process Responsibilities**
   * If someone doesn’t show up for a meeting, their contributions are decided by those in attendance.
   * Attendance at group meetings is expected at every meeting. Members should have a reasonable excuse for absence.

**6. Pull Request reviews**
   * Members are expected to monitor GitHub on a regular basis such that pull requests are reviewed in a timely manner and everyone’s branches stay up-to-date.
   * Members reviewing pull requests must be critical in their approval process. Are expected to reach out to whoever made the pull request for full clarity if there is confusion about the code.  

**7. Documentation**
   * Each member is expected to document their work.
   * Members should use good commenting practices.
   * The group must have all panning documentation available to all members, and future developers.

**8. Outside assignments**
   * It will be expected of each group member to come to each meeting prepared with what they agreed to do between meetings. This will help make the group meetings more effective and make the work easier to complete. If members are not prepared for a meeting, their evaluation for the group project will be affected.

**9. Coding standards**
   * Members are expected to pull from the working branch before beginning any new work so that the application they are working on is up to date with the newest version.
   * Members should also double check with other members using the Slack group chat if there were updates that haven’t been pushed to the branch.

**10. Remediation**
   * We will bring up for discussion in our group any perceived violation of the rules. We will decide by consensus in our group how to handle them. If dissatisfaction or problems persist, we agree to pursue dispute resolution processes through our professor, but only after trying to handle it within our group.
