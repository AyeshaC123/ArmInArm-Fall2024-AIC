# How to contribute to the ArmInArm project

## Issues and Bugs

If there are any parts of the program that do not work correctly, or that you would like to improve, please create an issue in the Issues tab of the repository.
This helps to keep tasks organized and will allow all contributors to see progress and provide their own input on how to solve these problems.

## Coding Guidelines

When contributing code to the project, please follow these guidelines:

- Code should be self-documenting
- Comments are made where function is not obvious
- Naming conventions for Rails and the project overall are followed
- Time is allowed for other contributors to review your contributions before pushing

## Future plans

Future plans for this module, the Pre-Registration form and QR code generator, are to connect the My Account page with the appointment system created by Team 21.
