# Team Guidelines:
- We meet on Wednesdays at 2
- Give rationale for any new feature that are presented ( use cases )
- Keep others updated about what issue you’re working on (e.g. via slack/github issues)
- Gracefully accept and provide constructive feedback
- Be respectful of everyone’s opinions, and consider their feelings
- Prioritize the needs of the community (i.e. ArmInArm staff/clients)
- Give 24 hr grace period to respond to messages
- Test the application as new features are added.
- Stay up-to-date with the project features (i.e. stay familiar with others’ work on the project and new features)
- Request insight/feedback on currently worked on issues
