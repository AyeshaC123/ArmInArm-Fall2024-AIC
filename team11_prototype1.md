### Prototype 1

1. Upon visiting one of Arm In Arm’s food pantry locations, we observed that there is an inefficiency in the process of registering new clients to be served. We want to create a way to reduce the time it takes for a new client to register into the system and receive their QR code.
2. The objective of the proposed project is to streamline the registration process and alleviate the workload of Arm in Arm staff by enabling clients to self-register. More specifically we plan to aid clients in registering with the addition of a help feature, and an enhanced user interface.
3. Our project is all about making the registration process at Arm in Arm smoother and faster. We're putting the power in the clients' hands by creating a user-friendly self-registration system. Our focus is on creating a helpful interface that guides clients through the process effortlessly. We're adding question mark icons to explain any confusing parts of the form and a handy "help" button at the end, so clients can easily flag any missing information. This means less waiting time for clients and less workload for Arm in Arm staff. Plus, we're designing the form to be clean, simple, and easy to navigate for an all-around better experience.
4. It is crucial for our project team to maintain ongoing contact with the stakeholders, particularly the staff members at Arm in Arm, for several reasons:

Understanding Needs and Requirements: The staff at Arm in Arm will be the primary users of the application. Regular communication with them ensures that the team understand their needs, and preferences. This understanding is essential for developing a solution that effectively addresses their requirements and enhances their work flow. 

Feedback and Iteration: Continuous communication allows for the collection of feedback on the application’s features, usability, and performance. This feedback enables the team to iterate the solution to make necessary adjustments.

Client Satisfaction: Our direct contact with the Arm in Arm clients is limited, but communication with the Arm in Arm staff will give us valuable insight about the clients. It is very important that the application aligns with the expectations and requirements of the clients so that the will be willing and able to fill out the forms. 

Anticipating Challenges: By staying in touch with the stake holders, the team can anticipate any potential issues that may arise. For instance, during discussions with Arm in Arm staff, it was revealed that relying solely on address-based registration checks could overlook families residing in shared accommodations, where multiple families may occupy the same residence. This insight, provided by the stakeholders, underscores the importance of considering nuanced factors that might not have been initially apparent to the project team.

Overall, ongoing contact with stakeholders is essential for ensuring that the project delivers a solution that meets the needs and expectations of its users, maximizes client satisfaction and minimizes risks and challenges along the way. 

5. Our collaboration with Arm in Arm focuses on addressing the pressing challenge of food insecurity by streamlining their administrative processes. Arm in Arm plays a vital role in supporting families facing food insecurity through the generous donations and support of various stakeholders. However, the current registration procedure, which entails gathering extensive demographic information, has become a significant bottleneck. Volunteers at Arm in Arm find themselves spending several minutes registering each new client at the door, causing delays and adding unnecessary stress.

Our project aims to alleviate this burden by enabling clients to complete their registration either at home or partially before arriving at Arm in Arm. By simplifying and expediting the registration process, we seek to reduce stress for volunteers, minimize wait times for clients, and ultimately increase Arm in Arm's capacity to assist a larger number of families in need. Through this streamlined approach, we hope to contribute to the organization's mission of providing essential support to those experiencing food insecurity while promoting efficiency and accessibility in their operations.

6. Security and privacy are important when dealing with sensitive client information. Only staff members with the appropriate permission have the ability to review forms flagged as needing help. This ensures sensitive client information is accessed and handled only by authorized personnel, which minimizes the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information. The system also uses encryption to secure data transmission and storage, which in turn prevents interception and unauthorized access to sensitive client information.
