# Team 14 - Team Code

## Our Guidelines

- **Meetings:** We meet every Monday at 5 pm, regardless of how far the next deadline is, to ensure the team stays on track.

- **Meeting Absence:** If someone is unable to make a meeting, please let the group know in advance if possible and check the document for the assigned task.

- **Communication:** Communication should be addressed as soon as possible on Slack, preferably by the end of the day (EOD).

- **Egoless Programming:** We practice egoless programming, where teamwork and problem-solving prevail over personal ego and pride.

- **Inclusive Language:** We cultivate an environment that embraces everyone with open and inclusive language.

- **Respect for Diversity:** We demonstrate respect for diverse perspectives and individual experiences.

- **Constructive Feedback:** We handle constructive feedback gracefully and with an open mind.

- **Empathy:** We show empathy towards other community members.

- **Stakeholder Interests:** We keep in mind the best interests of all stakeholders.

- **Accountability:** We accept responsibility and apologize to those affected by our mistakes, and we learn from the experience.
