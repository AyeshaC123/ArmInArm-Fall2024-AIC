# Team 14's attempt at beginning to integrate projects
### Project Name: Client Profile:
### An engaging description of the project, including how and why it will add value to extant understanding of the project:
    Our project will involve creating a software system that allows clients of Arm In Arm to create individual client profiles that hold client specific data that is valuable for Arm In Arm volunteers to use when crafting a client’s bag. Data such as a client’s food preferences, allergies, dietary restrictions and data pertaining to a client’s household all are valuable for volunteers when enabling the best experience for clients. Clients can also update,delete and modify these profiles to ensure data correctness and validity. By being able to have easy to reference information about clients, there will be less guess work on Arm In Arm’s part about their client’s needs. Instead there will be more confidence from Arm In Arm that they are sufficiently serving their clients as well as clients feeling valued and understood by the Arm In Arm staff. Client Profiles would limit the issue of long lines and increase client safety but allow clients to simply come in, give the volunteer their name and receive their personalized bag. This would also lessen disorganization within Arm In Arm through that come-and-go process, giving the staff ample time to pre-build bags and allow for more efficiency. Our project goes beyond creating profiles, it redefines the experience for clients choosing to come to Arm In Arm. We recognize that every individual has unique needs and preferences, especially when it comes to building a grocery bag for a client and their families. Our software will offer a seamless way for clients to get the most out of their weekly grocery bags through individualized client profiles. Admins will be able to search for a client's data by a client identifier which is client ID, first name and last name. 

### A discussion of the social, ethical, economic and the real world issues that must be addressed for the project to deliver value, and how the team will do this:
    By moving Arm In Arm’s clientele to our software, several issues must be addressed and have been communicated within our team. We understand a majority of Arm In Arm’s clients may not speak or understand English and would be disadvantaged due to a language barrier. For that we have implemented a way for our software to include a drop down menu that allows the users to choose which language our project should conduct in. We have chosen English, Spanish, Creole and French as those were the languages we observed from our previous visit. Our project directly relates with data handling and management, and this can be concerning to many users. The issue of ensuring privacy for secure data is one we make sure to keep in mind as we build our project. Our group thought of utilizing a 2 factor identification system to ensure that the user logging in and getting access is the correct user to do so. This will allow clients to feel more safe about inputting sensitive information as well as prevent any security data leakage. We will also implement a saving functionality to ensure none of the data inputted by the client will ever be lost. We must practice a high degree of confidentiality in order to satisfy the concerns of the clients regarding their information and data privacy. The software should reveal information on a need-to-know basis and with the consent of those whose information is being recorded and revealed. Additionally, our software should be accessible to clients and should take caution not to discriminate intentionally or unintentionally. Accessibility for clients would mean accommodating language barriers; no client should be excluded from this system due to not speaking a “required language”. Taking caution to not discriminate with this system would mean ensuring the system does not inherently discriminate against any demographic groups based on how the software is designed. For example, the software should not inherently be unusable or exclude people of certain nationalities or different age groups. We plan on crafting our system to be very inclusive and accessible through our language preference and food preference options.
