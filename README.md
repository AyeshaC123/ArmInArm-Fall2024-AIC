# Team 22 - Pre-registration module and QR code generator

	The project that Team 22 will be designing is a pre registration system for Arm in Arm clients, which will allow clients to be identified quickly and easily when picking up food from an Arm in Arm location. This application will be based on a set of questions Arm in Arm has provided for us. We will use the questions to create an online form in a way. This online form will allow applicants to register as an Arm in Arm customer from a remote device as opposed to going in person and getting asked these questions face to face. This will save Arm in Arm a lot of time and resources to register an applicant into the system. In terms of the user (applicant) that uses this application, we will implement it in a way that it is easy and straightforward to use. This way they can sign up as soon as possible, and receive the proper help they need. Once the user fills out this form they will be generated an id and more that is associated with all of their personal information. They can use this id to identify themselves at food pickup locations, so they can receive their food fast. Arm in Arm has already stressed the more people that are pre registered the faster the line moves at pickup locations. Our goal is to increase the number of applicants that can pre register online assuming they have access to a remote device. The user's newly entered information will be held in a database where Arm in Arm can access it whenever it is needed. Overall this should not completely resolve the issue of non registered customers showing up to locations and asking for food, but the goal is to lessen that number. We hope to make Arm in Armâ€™s life easier with this application!
