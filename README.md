# Team 22 - Pre-registration module, QR code Generator, and My Account Page 

>  The project that Team 22 will be designing is a pre registration system for Arm in Arm clients, which will allow clients to be identified quickly and easily when picking up food from an Arm in Arm location. This application will be based on a set of questions Arm in Arm has provided for us. We will use the questions to create an online form. This online form will allow applicants to register as an Arm in Arm customer from a remote device as opposed to going in person and getting asked these questions face to face. This will save Arm in Arm a lot of time and resources to register an applicant into the system. In terms of the user (applicant) that uses this application, we will implement it in a way that it is easy and straightforward to use. This way they can sign up as soon as possible, and receive the proper help they need. Once the user fills out this form they will be generated an unique QR-code that is associated with all of their personal information. After the form is submitted and the QR-code is generated it will be displayed on a "my account" page which will allow them to screenshot their personal Qr-code and edit/update any personal information they answered on the pre-registration form. Also on this "my account" page the client will also be able to add additional members to their household (i.e., spouse, siblings, dependents, etc.). The QR-code is displayed on this page to be screenshotted and used to identify themselves at food pickup locations, so they can receive their food fast. Arm in Arm has already stressed the more people that are pre-registered the faster the line moves at pickup locations. Our goal is to increase the number of applicants that can pre-register online assuming they have access to a remote device. The user's newly entered information will be held in a database where Arm in Arm can access it whenever it is needed. Overall this should not completely resolve the issue of non registered customers showing up to locations and asking for food, but the goal is to lessen that number. We hope to make Arm in Arm’s life easier with this application!

### A discussion of the social, ethical, economic and the real world issues that must be addressed for the project to deliver value, and how the team will do this:
    By moving Arm In Arm’s clientele to our software, several issues must be addressed and have been communicated within our team. We understand a majority of Arm In Arm’s clients may not speak or understand English and would be disadvantaged due to a language barrier. For that we have implemented a way for our software to include a drop down menu that allows the users to choose which language our project should conduct in. We have chosen English, Spanish, Creole and French as those were the languages we observed from our previous visit. Our project directly relates with data handling and management, and this can be concerning to many users. The issue of ensuring privacy for secure data is one we make sure to keep in mind as we build our project. Our group thought of utilizing a 2 factor identification system to ensure that the user logging in and getting access is the correct user to do so. This will allow clients to feel more safe about inputting sensitive information as well as prevent any security data leakage. We will also implement a saving functionality to ensure none of the data inputted by the client will ever be lost. We must practice a high degree of confidentiality in order to satisfy the concerns of the clients regarding their information and data privacy. The software should reveal information on a need-to-know basis and with the consent of those whose information is being recorded and revealed. Additionally, our software should be accessible to clients and should take caution not to discriminate intentionally or unintentionally. Accessibility for clients would mean accommodating language barriers; no client should be excluded from this system due to not speaking a “required language”. Taking caution to not discriminate with this system would mean ensuring the system does not inherently discriminate against any demographic groups based on how the software is designed. For example, the software should not inherently be unusable or exclude people of certain nationalities or different age groups. We plan on crafting our system to be very inclusive and accessible through our language preference and food preference options.
