# Project Proposal

1. Description of the problem to be solved.

A problem that the volunteer organization “Arm In Arms'' has with their volunteers is how to best organize people and assign tasks to them. Today, the task allocation process is both labor intensive and time consuming, taking away from the organization’s core objective. This stems from bad coordination and from a lack of any formalized structure to connect volunteers to tasks which utilize their skills, strengths and talents. The result is that volunteers frequently end up doing things that don’t best leverage them or bring the most impact to the organization.

One major problem is the mismatch of volunteers based on their language abilities. Volunteers who don't know the language of a task get accidentally scheduled for work that requires language abilities (filling out paperwork, or communicating directly with the customer). People with talent or skill-sets in a specific area could be assigned to tasks such as food pag preparation, which is not necessarily the best use of that volunteer's abilities. This lack of efficient distribution of volunteer time has a negative impact on morale and productivity of the volunteers as well as the overall ability of Arm n’ Arm to deliver on our mission: giving people access to the basic services they desperately need. So solving for this challenge in creating a more efficient and scalable task delegation system is essential to improve organizational impact and the volunteers' experience.  


 2. Description of the objective of the proposed project to address the problem. 

The objective of our project is to create a more efficient volunteer organization system for Arm in Arm. We plan to create a web application that will ask potential volunteers to provide their skill sets, so that we can assign them to relevant roles and create a more effective system where each volunteer is clear about their tasks for the day. This will also allow Arm In Arm to better promote volunteer opportunities. 

3. Description of how the project will meet this objective. 

The project will meet this objective by assigning volunteers to roles that are most relevant to them. This will efficiently utilize the strengths of each volunteer as they will be helping in areas that they are most qualified and passionate about. It will also allow Arm In Arm to be able to better plan their days, as they will have a clear count regarding how many volunteers there will be for a specific day and what they will do. This will save time and is more efficient than assigning volunteers to different tasks each morning. It will also ensure that there isn’t a shortage or excess of volunteers for each day. 

4. Explanation of what aspect of the project is innovative, and why. 

The ability to match volunteers with tasks that match their strengths in an efficient and optimizable manner. Compared to the recent ways that were being used, our project will give the following tasks to the volunteers that best fits that position, maximizing efficiently both the workers and helping customers with the specific aid they may need.

This project is also innovative from the point that we were moving a lot of things that were being done by hand or manually virtually, therefore cutting down some of the extra time needed to complete certain tasks

8. A simple use case diagram showing the project functionality. Identify the functionality that will be implemented in each prototype and completed within the time constraints of the semester. Specify functionality that is beyond the semester scope but could be added in future versions.
